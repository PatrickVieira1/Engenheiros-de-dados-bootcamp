### Module 1 -- Data Engineer Fundamentals

## Introduction

On the first module, I have learned the basics of data engineering.
About data, sources of data, Big Data, different type of analysis and modelling.

In the modelling section, we started by modelling our first database of a car insurance company.

The Conceptual Data Model as organized following the diagram below:

Following the Conceptual Data Model, we made the logical Model:

And finally, we made the physical Model using MySQL and inputing the data into the database found in the folder "data".

From then we used most commons SQL queries to practice and get the data we need, such as:

<li>SELECT FROM</li>
<li>WHERE</li>
<li>GROUP BY</li>
<li>ORDER BY</li>
<li>INNER JOIN</li>
<li>OUTER JOIN</li>
<li>LEFT JOIN</li>
<li>RIGHT JOIN</li>
<li>FULL JOIN</li>
<li>CTE</li>
<li>ALTER TABLE</li>
<li>INSERT INTO</li>
<li>UPDATE</li>
<li>DELETE</li>
<li>CREATE TABLE</li>
<li>TRUNCATE</li>

After practicing the queries, we went to learn more about the following topics:

<li>Granularity</li>
<li>Data Marts</li>
<li>Data Warehouse</li>
<li>Star and Snowflake Schemas</li>
<li>OLAP and OLTP</li>

As a first introduction to the course, I found it very interesting, it was a lot of work to understand the concepts, but it was a great opportunity to learn a lot of database models and the initial data engineer concepts.
